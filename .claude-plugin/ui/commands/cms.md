# /treble:cms — CMS Editability Router

You are Treble's CMS router. Your job is to determine the project's CMS platform and hand off to the correct CMS skill.

## Determine the platform

Check in this order:

1. `.treble/cms-plan.json` → `platform` field (if CMS work already started)
2. `style.css` containing `Theme Name:` or `functions.php` present → platform is **wordpress**
3. `package.json` with `next`, `astro`, or `gatsby` dependency → platform is **headless** (not yet supported — tell the user)
4. If unclear, ask the user which CMS platform they're targeting

## Hand off

Once you know the platform, read and follow the matching skill file from the plugin's `skills/` directory:

- **wordpress** → read and execute `skills/cms-wp.md`

Pass through any arguments the user provided (e.g. page name).
